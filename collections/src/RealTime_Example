LinkedHashSet:
online store
No duplicates — if a user views the same product again, it should not appear twice.
Order of viewing — you want to display in order from oldest to newest (or maybe newest first, depending on UI).
Fast lookup / insertion / removal — you need to quickly check if this item was already viewed and update the list.


ArrayDeque:
movie theater
People arriving late might want to go to the back of the line.
VIP guests might be allowed to join at the front.
If someone leaves (in a hurry), they might leave from front or back.
At any time, you want to see who is at the front or back.


HashSet:
instagram username 
whatsapp
You don’t want duplicates — each tag should appear only once.
You don’t care about the order of tags.
